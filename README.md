# Dashboard App

Dashboard template built using React, material ui and highcharts. Will be a blog entry for this application in the future.

## Dev Notes
This was a fun app to work on, even after I had accomplished what was the UI/UX goal of the app I wanted to continue working on it and keep improving it. Might consider making a dev blog article using this as a template in the future.

## Running the app

```
git clone git@github.com:Niravpatel129/dashboard-design-prototype.git
cd ./dashboard-design-prototype
npm install
npm start
```
